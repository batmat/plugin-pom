Parent POM for Jenkins Plugins

This new parent POM is decoupled from the core Jenkins project, both from the Maven and repository perspectives.

The main changes are:
* Reduced number of overridable properties. All references (e.g. dependencies and plugin versions) not
thought to be overridden are no longer based on properties. The main remaining overridable properties are:
  * `jenkins.version`: The Jenkins version required by the plugin. Current default is `1.625.3`
  * `jenkins-test-harness.version`: The JTH version used to test plugin. The default is `2.1`.
  Uses split test-harness (see [JENKINS-32478](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32478)).
  If the required Jenkins version is 1.580.1 or higher, JTH 2.1 is recommended.
  * `hpi-plugin.version`: The HPI Maven Plugin version used by the plugin. Current default is `1.115`
  * `stapler-plugin.version`: The Stapler Maven plugin version required by the plugin. Current default is `1.17`
  * `java.level`: The Java version to use to build the plugin. Current default is `7`
  * `java.level.test`: The Java version to use to build the plugin tests. Current default is `7`.
  * In order to make their versions the same as the used core version, `slf4jVersion`, `node.version` and `npm.version`
  properties are provided.
* Tests are skipped during the `perform` phase of a release (can be overridden by setting `release.skipTests` to false).
* General clean up.

Being able to specify the `jenkins.version` simplifies testing the plugin with different core versions, which is
important, among others, for the Plugin Compatibility Testing.

In order to use the new POM:
* Change the parent POM of your plugin:
```
  <parent>
    <groupId>org.jenkins-ci.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.3</version>
    <relativePath />
  </parent>
```
* Override the needed properties, e.g.:
```
  <properties>
    <jenkins.version>1.609.1</jenkins.version>
    <hpi-plugin.version>1.106</hpi-plugin.version>
  </properties>
```
